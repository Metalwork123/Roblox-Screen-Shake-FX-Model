insert Remotes into ReplicatedStorage
insert ClientReciever into StarterGui
insert CameraShaker into Replicated Storage.

If you look in the Remotes folder you can see a variety of different shakes that do different things.
If you wish to make the shake happen to everyone then use game.ReplicatedStorage.Remotes.Camera.[SCREENSHAKE]:FireAllClients()

And thats all!
